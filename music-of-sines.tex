\textbf{Comments:} As per the instructions, comments should be made for
the results of this experiment, though we were unsure whether a separate
set of comments should be produced for each computation. Given that the
computations were rather repetitive, we have made the decision to only
include one set of comments for all trials at the end of this section.

\par

We have identified several sources of error, which we define in the
below list. We strongly believe that these sources of error are the
reasons why the composite waves we obtained were not exactly identical
to those produced by our graphing software. Indeed, in all cases, the
waves were close, though they were far from identical (see Figures
\ref{fig:combo-1}, \ref{fig:combo-2}, and \ref{fig:combo-3}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  The imprecision of the tuning forks
\item
  The imprecision of the computer's microphone
\item
  The imprecision of the oscilloscope
\item
  Constructive interference due to the surrounding environment
\end{enumerate}

Further elaboration on each of these sources of error can be found
below.

\hypertarget{the-imprecision-of-the-tuning-forks}{%
\subsection*{The imprecision of the tuning
forks}\label{the-imprecision-of-the-tuning-forks}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The imprecision of the tuning forks}

We suspect it does not come as much of a surprise that the tuning forks
employed in this experiment were not very precise. Take the note F4, for
instance. \href{https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html}{A quick
google search} reveals that the accepted frequency of F4 is 349.23 Hz.
That said, the frequency inscribed on the F4 tuning fork was 341.1. This
is a percent error of 2.33\% right off the bat.

\par

In addition, some of the tuning forks were strangely identical, which
suggests that the the value was written on the each of the forks was
produced without any tests having been conducted to support it.

\par

We would like to share a quick test that can be conducted in order to
support this argument; take a tuning fork in a quiet environment and
make it vibrate. Consult an oscilloscope and take note of the frequency.
Then, use an electronic device capable of producing a pure sine wave
(i.e.~a phone) and play the same note into the oscilloscope in order to
record its wave. You will notice that the frequencies are different.
Even in a perfectly quiet room, the fork is unable to produce a pure
sine wave.

\par

Finally, in hindsight, the fact that the forks were repeatedly banged
against the wall probably did not aid their precision. By the end of the
experiment, many of them no longer had perfect edges. Although we
recognize our lack of expertise in the domain, we suspect that dents in
the forks must have introduced some sort of imprecision.

\par

\hypertarget{the-imprecision-of-the-computers-microphone}{%
\subsection*{The Imprecision of the Computer's
Microphone}\label{the-imprecision-of-the-computers-microphone}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Imprecision of the Computer's
Microphone}

The mac we used was an A1708. Now, it is very difficult to obtain
technical specifications about it's microphone, apart from the fact that
it has one (thank you so much Apple), but
\href{https://www.macworld.com/article/2367142/understanding-the-limitations-of-a-macs-microphone.html}{a
quick Google search} reveals that it is far from being adequate to
recording anything above the quality of a FaceTime call. In other words,
the Mac microphone is great for speaking with a friend, but for
high-precision experiments, it is so subpar that Apple has decided not
to even post its specifications. In light of this, we suspect that it
may have been unable to faithfully record the waves we created.

\hypertarget{the-imprecision-of-the-osilloscope}{%
\subsection*{The Imprecision of the
Osilloscope}\label{the-imprecision-of-the-osilloscope}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Imprecision of the Osilloscope}

Although the oscilloscope app we used had undeniable potential as an
educational tool, its quality was extremely questionable. For instance,
when we were calculating the wavelength, we counted the divisions and
approximated. Because each tick on the graph was 0.2 ms, the precision
of the oscilloscope itself was about \(\pm 0.1\)ms, and this does not
include the imprecision of the microphone, which may have been much
lower. The wavelength of middle C (C4) is about 3.9 milliseconds (in
theory), so the percent of the oscilloscope alone is about 3\%.
Moreover, changing the parameters of the oscilloscope seemed to produce
illogical results (though this may also have been due to the surrounding
environment), which suggests that there was perhaps a bug in the
underlying javascript code of the application.

\hypertarget{the-constructive-interference-due-to-the-surrounding-environment}{%
\subsection*{The Constructive interference due to the Surrounding
Environment}\label{the-constructive-interference-due-to-the-surrounding-environment}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Constructive interference due to
the Surrounding Environment}

The room we conducted our tests in was far from silent despite it being
a library; we conducted our tests amid a symphony of chatter, of banging
tuning forks, and of shuffling students This undoubtedly produced some
interferance, which changed our results. We suspect that this was the
factor that contributed the most to the descrepancy between the
theoretical wave and the actual wave we obtained. A simple experiment
reveals this imprecision; measure the sine wave of the tuning fork in a
quiet room, and it takes two seconds and only one try to get an
acceptable wave (the precision of the forks themselves, however, is
another story). Do the same in a noisy room, and it can take several
tries to obtain the same results. Ambient noise has a significant part
to play when it comes to precision.
